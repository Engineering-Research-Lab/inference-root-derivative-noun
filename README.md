### Test demo app

 [Test demo app](https://github.com/ladooniani/inference-root-algorithm) is a desktop application software of algorithm inventive concept and logic design demo example, process implementation program, system module or code testing tool, created and used in the [TAI lab](https://ladooniani.github.io/tailab/) research and workflow environment.

# Derivative noun algorithm

The derivative nouns sentence  algorithm represents tag type sentence search and intent recognition method from the higher count of input derivative  nouns according to data structure organization.
 
 # Inference root algorithm
 
"Inference root algorithm" analysis is an experimental way to find the meaning of the words in a sentence without a direct link between the word and its meaning at the time of determination of this relation by looking, counting, and weighing of the derivative noun in value root matrix up to a certain depth of subsequent connections with dynamic dependencies through defining indications as new keys in updated memory information content.

As the semantic weights of the counter, the method implements a dichotomous model of "Porphyrian tree" with a genus hierarchy of oppositions and interpretation of values from peak size by the downward curve. 

 ### Peaks of curve

Tree represents determined matrix root values with stochastic keys of inference, and default matrix value scales.

The "human brain" and "robot brain" inputs shows sentences analysis with combination of root values, derivative key and nouns.

The counting of key values qualifies conclusion by the higher count in found links and weighing of oppositions to define and return answer output, which makes hypothesis value true.

The sentence "human and android" and word "future" inputs result shows analysis with combination of root values, derivative key, nouns and opposition equality.

 The call of the request shows the basic output noun assignment rule for a new meaning key in the root matrix values
